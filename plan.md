# CONTEXT

You are designing a maximalist, enterprise-grade website for **Elevatio** (elevatio.site), a business transformation and strategy firm that helps organizations scale smarter, align teams, and implement high-impact systems. The goal is to create a visually striking, professionally polished web experience that commands attention while maintaining credibility.

# ROLE

You are an expert web designer and creative technologist specializing in shader-based animations, interactive visual effects, and cutting-edge web experiences. You blend maximalist aesthetics with enterprise-level execution.

## Core Requirements

* Project Type: Enterprise-grade website
* Purpose: Showcase Elevatio’s transformation framework, consulting services, and enterprise solutions
* Design Approach: Maximalist aesthetic
* Scope: Minimum 4–5 complete sections

## Website Sections

### Section 1: Hero

* Custom shader-based animated text (e.g. “Elevate Your Organization”, “Transform with Clarity”)
* Interactive mouse hover effects
* Beautiful, eye-catching typography
* **CRITICAL**: Text must be fully responsive and never overflow the viewport

### Sections 2–5: Additional Sections

Design at least 3–4 more sections from:

* Services / Features showcase (e.g. “Peak Operator Blueprint”, “Data & Insights”, “Change Enablement”)
* About / Company overview (Elevatio’s mission, history, team)
* Portfolio / Case studies (previous client transformations)
* Testimonials / Social proof (client quotes)
* CTA / Contact section (book a discovery call)
* Process / How it works (framework, step-by-step)

## Visual Treatment (Applied Across All Sections)

* Dithering textures
* Wavy / fluid motion
* Groovy animations
* Rich gradient overlays

## Design Direction

### Style Keywords

**maximalist • groovy • wavy • gradients • dithering • enterprise-grade • futuristic / cyber-tech**

### Theme & Color Palette

* Use a **dark-mode, cyberpunk-inspired theme**: deep charcoal or near-black background provides a polished and high-contrast base. ([Mockplus][1])
* Accent with **neon / futuristic gradient colors**: electric blues, magentas, purples, and maybe teal. ([ColorMagic][2])
* Apply **multi-stop gradients** (e.g., blue → magenta → teal) plus glow / neon effects for a high-tech, energetic feel. ([Ithy][3])
* Use textures (dithering or noise) over gradient surfaces to add depth and richness.
* Ensure accessibility and contrast by choosing off-white text and avoiding pure white or overly saturated tones for backgrounds. ([minitoolshub.com][4])

## Technical Considerations

* Maintain enterprise-level polish
* Optimize performance despite heavy visuals
* Ensure smooth shader rendering
* Responsive mouse-tracking
* **CRITICAL**: Hero text must use responsive font sizing (clamp, vw units, or media queries)
* **CRITICAL**: Prevent horizontal overflow — all text must fit within viewport width
* Use proper container constraints and text wrapping
* Test text sizing across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Planning & Architecture

* Define website structure and key sections
* Plan shader implementation approach
* Map out user interaction flows
* Outline animation sequences

### Step 2: Design System

* Establish color palette and gradients (reflecting Elevatio’s cyber / neon-tech brand)
* Define typography hierarchy
* Plan dithering and texture treatments
* Design component variations

### Step 3: Technical Implementation

* Set up shader infrastructure
* Implement mouse tracking system
* Build animation framework
* Optimize performance (e.g., reduce shader cost, lazy-load where appropriate)

### Step 4: Final Deliverable

Provide full HTML code for quick preview:

* Complete, functional **single-file HTML**
* All CSS and JavaScript **inline**
* Ready to copy/paste and test
* Fully interactive with all effects working
